abstract = {In this work, we study the existence of, low amplitude, phase-shift multibreathers for small values of the linear coupling in Klein–Gordon chains with interactions beyond the classical nearest-neighbor (NN) ones. In the proper parameter regimes, the considered lattices bear connections to models beyond one spatial dimension, namely the so-called zigzag lattice, as well as the two-dimensional square lattice or coupled chains. We examine initially the necessary persistence conditions of the system derived by the so-called Effective Hamiltonian Method, in order to seek for unperturbed solutions whose continuation is feasible. Although this approach provides useful insights, in the presence of degeneracy, it does not allow us to determine if they constitute true solutions of our system. In order to overcome this obstacle, we follow a different route. By means of a Lyapunov–Schmidt decomposition, we are able to establish that the bifurcation equation for our models can be considered, in the small energy and small coupling regime, as a perturbation of a corresponding, beyond nearest-neighbor, discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation. There, nonexistence results of degenerate phase-shift discrete solitons can be demonstrated by an additional Lyapunov–Schmidt decomposition, and translated to our original problem on the Klein–Gordon system. In this way, among other results, we can prove nonexistence of four-site vortex-like waveforms in the zigzag Klein–Gordon model. Finally, briefly considering a one-dimensional model bearing similarities to the square lattice, we conclude that the above strategy is not efficient for the proof of the existence or nonexistence of vortices due to the higher degeneracy of this configuration.}

The method involves no diagonalization, but just iterations of a map, starting from trivial solutions of the anti-continuous limit. Approximate analytical expressions are presented and compared with the numerical results. The linear stability of the calculated stationary states is discussed and the structure of the linear stability spectrum is analytically obtained for relatively large values of nonlinearity.}

    abstract = { The complex dynamics that arise in certain nonlinear partial differential equations in time and in one space dimension are studied. In the general case considered, the equation admits a solitary wave in the form of a pulse tailing off exponentially, fore and aft, with possibly oscillatory character. Complicated solutions are described by a superposition of many such solitary structures in interaction. The description is asymptotic in terms of a parameter that becomes exponentially small as the ratio of typical pulse separation to pulse width becomes large. The outcome is a set of dynamical equations for the motion of the individual pulses with nearest neighbor interactions. This system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) admits a wide range of patterns, both regular and chaotic. The stability theory of such patterns is sketched and the continuum limit of the lattice-dynamical equations of the pulses is given. }

abstract = {We provide an overview of recent experimental and theoretical developments in the area of optical discrete solitons. By nature, discrete solitons represent self-trapped wavepackets in nonlinear periodic structures and result from the interplay between lattice diffraction (or dispersion) and material nonlinearity. In optics, this class of self-localized states has been successfully observed in both one- and two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. In recent years such photonic lattices have been implemented or induced in a variety of material systems, including those with cubic (Kerr), quadratic, photorefractive, and liquid-crystal nonlinearities. In all cases the underlying periodicity or discreteness leads to altogether new families of optical solitons that have no counterpart whatsoever in continuous systems. We first review the linear properties of photonic lattices that are key in the understanding of discrete solitons. The physics and dynamics of the fundamental discrete and gap solitons are then analyzed along with those of many other exotic classes — e.g. twisted, vector and multi-band, cavity, spatio-temporal, random-phase, vortex, and non-local lattice solitons, just to mention a few. The possibility of all-optically routing optical discrete solitons in 2D and 3D periodic environments using soliton collisions is also presented. Finally, soliton formation in optical quasi-crystals and at the boundaries of waveguide array structures are discussed.}

abstract = {We study kink dynamics in a very discrete sine-Gordon system where the kink width is of the order of the lattice spacing. Numerical simulations exhibit new properties of kinks in this case: they lose the memory of their initial velocity and propagate preferentially at well-defined velocities which correspond to quasi-steady states, while a kink moving at other velocities suffers relatively high rates of radiation of small amplitude oscillations. When a small external driving force is applied to the system, the same velocities appear as plateus in the strongly nonlinear mobility of the kink. The energy radiated by the kink is calculated for a simple model that preserves the discrete character of the system, and the preferential velocities for the kink are obtained to good accuracy. Similar results may be expected to be valid for other discrete systems manifesting topological solitons. The numerical simulations reveal also new stable “multiple-kink” excitations which can propagate almost freely in extremely discrete systems where “ordinary” simple kinks are pinned to the lattice by discreteness. The stability of the “multiple-kinks” is discussed.}

We present two methods that yield quantitative predictions about the Floquet multipliers of the linear stability analysis around such exponentially localized in space, time-periodic orbits, based on the Aubry band method and the MacKay effective Hamiltonian method, and prove that by making the suitable assumptions about the form of the bands in the Aubry band theory, their conclusions are equivalent. Subsequently, we showcase the usefulness of the methods through a series of case examples including one-dimensional multi-breathers, and two-dimensional vortex breathers in the case of a lattice of linearly coupled oscillators with the Morse potential and in that of the discrete ϕ4 model. }

abstract = {Nonlinear classical Hamiltonian lattices exhibit generic solutions — discrete breathers. They are time-periodic and (typically exponentially) localized in space. The lattices have discrete translational symmetry. Discrete breathers are not confined to certain lattice dimensions. We will introduce the concept of these localized excitations and review their basic properties including dynamical and structural stability. We then focus on advances in the theory of discrete breathers in three directions — scattering of waves by these excitations, persistence of discrete breathers in long transient processes and thermal equilibrium, and their quantization. The second part of this review is devoted to a detailed discussion of recent experimental observations and studies of discrete breathers, including theoretical modelling of these experimental situations on the basis of the general theory of discrete breathers. In particular we will focus on their detection in Josephson junction networks, arrays of coupled nonlinear optical waveguides, Bose–Einstein condensates loaded on optical lattices, antiferromagnetic layered structures, PtCl based single crystals and driven micromechanical cantilever arrays.}

The base for the analysis is provided by the anticontinuous limit (ω negative and large enough) where all the solutions can be coded by the sequences of three symbols “−”, “0” and “+”. Using dynamical systems approach we show that this coding is valid for ω<ω∗≈−3.4533 and the point ω∗ is a point of accumulation of saddle-node bifurcations. Also we study other bifurcations of intrinsic localized modes which take place for ω>ω∗ and give the complete table of them for the solutions with codes consisting of less than four symbols."
